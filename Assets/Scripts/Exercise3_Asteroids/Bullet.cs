/*
 * Assignment: AsteroidsGame - Bullet Script - 2
 * 
 * Objective:
 * Implement a player controller for a spaceship in an Asteroids prototype. The player should be able to rotate the ship,
 * move forward, wrap around the screen, and shoot bullets. 
 * 
 * Requirements:   
 * PART 2: Shooting
 * 1. The bullets should start off moving in the direction they are spawned at a speed set by bulletSpeed. 
 *      This should be set in the Start method of this script.
 *      The movement of the bullet should be done with Physics applied to a Rigidbody2D.
 * 2. The bullets should be destroyed after bulletLifetime seconds or when they collide with an asteroid.
